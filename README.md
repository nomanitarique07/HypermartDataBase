# Natural Language to SQL Query Generator

This project demonstrates a streamlined NLP-to-SQL pipeline that converts layman-style user queries into executable SQL queries using rule-based logic and a large language model (LLaMA 3). Built with **FastAPI** and **SQLite**, it serves as a learning project for database-driven query systems enhanced by large language models.

## Features

- Converts natural language queries into SQL  
- Uses SQLite for backend database  
- Employs LLaMA 3 via Ollama for SQL generation  
- Outputs tabular results and a brief summary

## Example

- **Input (User Query):**

```json
{ "user_query": "Top-selling groceries products" }
```

- **Output:**

```json
{
  "query": "SELECT product_name FROM transactions WHERE product_type = 'Groceries' ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 1",
  "results": ["Flour"]
}
```

- **Console Output:**  
  `Flour` is the top-selling grocery product, indicating a high demand for baking essentials.
